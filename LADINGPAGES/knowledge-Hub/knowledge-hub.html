Access to learning opportunities

The National Business Initiative (NBI) has created an online application to improve the learning experience for technical and business-related topics.

Key features of the app include offline access to content; the ability to download and complete content activities with outcomes logged on the learning management system when connected; interactive engagement; self-paced self-learning; the option to register and manage your profile; and tracking of learning progress.

This app is part of the Installation, Repair and Maintenance (IRM) Initiative, which aims to unlock demand for jobs and create opportunities for youth to access those jobs. The Initiative is a collaboration between the NBI, the government and the private sector, offering demand-led skills training, workplace-based learning, and enterprise development with technology integration for a more dynamic learning process.
